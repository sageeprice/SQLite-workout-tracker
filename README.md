Simple node.js powered site for tracking workouts. Backed by an SQLite
instance.

Playground site with several purposes:
1. Learn how to use SQLite.
1. Get more experience with JS.
1. Test out Node.js for the backend.
1. Try out a Github based workflow.
1. At some point, actually track workouts (low priority).
